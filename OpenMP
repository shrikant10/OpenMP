Works in C C++ Fortran

Moore's Law -  No. of transistors incorporated in chip will approximately double in every two years.

Concurrency - Multiple tasks are logically active at one time
Parallism   - Multiple tasks are actually active at one time

Programs >> Concurrency >> Parallism

OpenMP - Open Multi Processing

> We have to find the concurrency in the program.
> Understand the algorithm strategy


1. API for writing multithreaded applications
2. A set of compiler directive and routines for paralles application programmers.
3. Greatly simplifies writing multi-threaded (MT) programs in Fortran C C++


OpenMP construts

#include <omp.h>

#pragma omp parallel - Give me the defalut no. of threads
followed by structure block

Context switching betwwen threads is easy.

Master thread has thread id 0. Rest are 1 2 3 ...

omp_set_num_threads(4);
omp_get_num_threads();
omp_get_thread_num();


threads have their personal stack and a shared heap

if data is declared inside #pragma omp parallel construct is allocated in stack i.e. it is private to the the thread.

while data declared outside it is allocated in heap and is available to all threads.

double omp_get_wtime();
